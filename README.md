## Python Bootcamp & Hackathon Project - Tarvone 
Note: This repo was originally cloned from: ```https://github.com/PLPAfrica/Feb-2024-PythonHack2.git``` 

Objectives During this bootcamp and hackathon, were to create a weather app using a Third-party API, where the aim was to:

- Understand JSON
- Understand how to work with Static files in Django
- Understand API
- Understand software development & Deployments
- Understand software testing with pytest
- Understand Database integration with Python Django

My project in particular uses the Weather API from ```https://www.weatherapi.com``` and also includes a Random Quote Generator API from ```https://type.fit/api/quotes``` as well as the Unsplash API from ```https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos``` to display weather updates and random quotes.

The Weather API in particular allows end users to input a city of their choice in order to get the relevant updates. It also renders a default city incase the user fails to input a city of their choice. On the side it uses the Unsplash API to display to the user a random picture of the selected city.
