_Disclaimer: this plugin is a fork from the official [Tailwind CSS Typography Plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) with different styles and settings_

## Documentation

For full documentation, visit [flowbite.com](https://flowbite.com/docs/components/typography/).
## Getting started

Flowbite Typography can be included as a plugin into an existing Tailwind CSS project and it is supposed to help you build websites faster by having a set of web components to work with built with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

### Require via NPM

Make sure that you have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" rel="nofollow" >Node.js</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" rel="nofollow" >Tailwind CSS</a> installed. 

1. Install the Flowbite Typography plugin via NPM:

```bash
npm install -D flowbite-typography
```

2. Require Flowbite Typography as a plugin inside the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {

    plugins: [
        require('flowbite-typography')
    ]

}
```

### Basic usage

Use the `format` class to apply the typography classes to all inline elements:

```html
<article class="format lg:format-lg">
  <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>
  <p>
    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread with cheese to their
    children, with the food earning such an iconic status in our culture that kids will often dress
    up as warm, cheesy loaf for Halloween.
  </p>
  <p>
    But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a series of rabies cases
    springing up around the country.
